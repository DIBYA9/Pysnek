**Speech Outline for the Snake Game Presentation:**

**Opening:**
“Good morning/afternoon everyone. We are from Asian International School, Class IX-B. My name is **Dibyadip Mitra**, and today we’re excited to present our project—a unique Snake game designed to align with the principles of **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**.”

**Introduction to the Team:**

- “The game's **UI and graphics** were designed by **Pratyush Chanda**, who created the game assets and ensured it looked visually engaging.”

**Main Speech (Game Concept):**
- “Our game has two modes: **easy** and **hard**, which represent different levels of health challenges people face in real life.”
- “There are **three types of food**: the **red and golden apples**, which represent healthy choices that make the snake grow stronger, and **plastic**, which represents unhealthy or harmful elements like pollution or bad habits.”
- “If the snake eats plastic or hits a wall, it dies—this reflects how bad decisions, whether it's in our health or our environment, can have serious consequences.”

**Linking to SDG 3 (Indirect Implementation):**
